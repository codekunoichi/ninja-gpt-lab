• Link each school’s NPC; note caveats (home equity, business ownership, merit not in NPC).
• FAFSA/CSS priority dates; “need-met” stance (if claimed by school) with source.
• Merit scholarship deadlines (often earlier than admission); note if separate app/interview/portfolio is needed.
• State grants and major state programs (link to state agency).
• Encourage SAI/EFC estimation if unknown; state assumptions if used.
